# Livre De Recettes

Livre De Recettes is the first full-stack application I've made. 
It was inspired by a simpler, much smaller task that was given in class, and it served as the perfect, yet challenging, introduction to the world of Restful API design, Spring Boot, Database Management, and the first step into the world of Javascript and frontend development.

The functionalities are quite straightforward. The initial recipes are loaded into the database via 2 SQL script files whenever the application starts, and the user has the ability to either update, add or delete recipes.

The backend is a simple Rest API built with Spring Boot, and Maven chosen as the build tool.
The DBMS is the H2 Database Engine.
The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React as the chosen Javascript library.

Challenges: Learning about Rest APIs, controllers, JSON data, HttpRequests, teaching myself Javascript / React.
